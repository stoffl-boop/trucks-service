## To run application locally:

1) Maven should be installed > https://maven.apache.org/install.html

2) By using Spring Boot Maven plugin we are able to create an executable jar with the next command:

   `mvn clean package`

3) Run the application using java -jar. For example:

   `$ java -jar target/truck-content-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## Alternative way:

IntellijIDEA IDE could be installed, as it already has built-in Maven, so TruckContentApplication is ready to be executed.
